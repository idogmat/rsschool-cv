## CODE EXAMPLE

##### Greatest common divisor
> *Find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. The integers can be large, so you need to find a clever solution.
The inputs x and y are always greater or equal to 1, so the greatest common divisor will always be an integer that is also greater or equal to 1.*

```
function mygcd(a,b){
  while(a != b) a > b ? a -= b : b -= a
  return a 
}
```
